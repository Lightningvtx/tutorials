# How to get your Riot cookies

This bot accepts only cookies so your login information is not used and or stored by the bot at all, however be advised cookies **ARE** stored.

This guide uses Chrome, but opera and any other browser except for firefox will work, because firefox doesn't show your whole cookie if it's too long.

First, go to [account.riotgames.com](https://account.riotgames.com) and log in if you aren't already. Also make sure that you have checked the __Remember me__ option when you are logging in, otherwise it will log you out of the bot after 24 hours.

Then: 
  1. Open a new tab and press `F12` (or `Ctrl+Shift+I`/`⌥⌘I`) to open devtools, head to the `Network` tab on the top right
  2. with the Network tab open, open this link on that tab `https://auth.riotgames.com/`
       **Note:** You will see a page saying "*An error occured!*" That is normal, ignore it.
  3. A new network request will appear called `auth.riotgames.com` in the Network tab, click on it
